Week 5: I had to first learn python, play starcraft, and get familiar with the pysc2 api. This took about two full weeks.
Most of the time was dedicated to learining python and getting familiar with the pysc2 api. Our team decided to go with python and
I was the only one who didn't know it so I had to learn quickly.

Week 6: More learning python, playing starcraft, and getting familiar with pysc2.

Week 7: First implementation of the bot. Following the only pysc2 tutorial avaialable. Planned to branch out in our own direction once we learned more.
We needed something working so the rest of our team could start their parts.

Week 8: Started refining the bot and developing better scouting methods. Took a long time to figure out the best way to reward it for scouting. In retrospect 
I would not choose QLearning again and would chose something more interesting like a genetic algorithm. My small knowledge of python and the non-existant pysc2
documentation made this step harder than it needed to be.

Week 9: Finalized the bot, finally got it to scout their base properly through an agressive scouting method of higher rewards the father away the enemies it sees are.

Week 10: Refactored the code into functions to make it more readable.

I worked together with Adam for most of the steps.
