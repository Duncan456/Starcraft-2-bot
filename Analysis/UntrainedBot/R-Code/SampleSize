#In order to use the ANOVA, we must check to see if our sample size is efficent
#this test assumes that we have already ran the power test. 

totalmean = sum(gmeans*group.samplesize)/sum(group.samplesize)
sizeofeffect = sqrt( sum( group.samplesize/sum(group.samplesize) *(gmeans -overall.mean)^2 )/MSE)
pwr.anova.test(k = a, f = effect.size, sig.level = alpha, power = desired.power)

#at the end of this we can check how many samples we needed in each group to run the analysis
