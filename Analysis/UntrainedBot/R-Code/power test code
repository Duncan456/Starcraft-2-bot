#why do we need to do power test?
#The power of a hypothesis test is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis (H0) 
#when a specific alternative hypothesis (H1) is true. 
#it is important for us to know how often we will make the correct decision when we reject our null hypothesis.
#ie the bots are all the same.
#probability of doing the correct thing

#finds the overall sample size
#finds the overall mean
#looks up the value of phi
#Finds the critival value of F (using pwr and R's built in functionality).
#calculates the power using the non-central F

#note we used the package called pwr.
this package gives funcationality to use qf and
